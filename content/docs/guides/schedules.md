Use `RolloutSchedule` to control when deployments can occur based on time windows, days of week, or date ranges.

## Create a Schedule

A schedule matches rollouts by label selector and defines rules for when deployments are allowed or blocked.

```yaml {filename="schedule.yaml"}
apiVersion: kuberik.com/v1alpha1
kind: RolloutSchedule
metadata:
  name: business-hours
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    gate.kuberik.com/pretty-name: "Business Hours Only"
    gate.kuberik.com/description: "Deployments allowed Mon-Fri 9 AM - 5 PM EST"
spec:
  rolloutSelector:
    matchLabels:
      schedule: business-hours
  rules:
    - name: "weekday-hours"
      timeRange:
        start: "09:00"
        end: "17:00"
      daysOfWeek:
        - Monday
        - Tuesday
        - Wednesday
        - Thursday
        - Friday
  timezone: "America/New_York"
  action: Allow
```

Label your Rollout to apply the schedule.

```yaml {filename="rollout.yaml"}
apiVersion: kuberik.com/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    schedule: business-hours
spec:
  releasesImagePolicy:
    name: my-app-policy
```

## Cluster-Wide Schedules

Use `ClusterRolloutSchedule` to apply schedules across namespaces.

```yaml {filename="cluster-schedule.yaml"}
apiVersion: kuberik.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRolloutSchedule
metadata:
  name: production-freeze
  annotations:
    gate.kuberik.com/pretty-name: "Holiday Freeze"
    gate.kuberik.com/description: "Blocks production deployments during holidays"
spec:
  rolloutSelector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  namespaceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      environment: production
  rules:
    - name: "holiday"
      dateRange:
        start: "2026-12-23"
        end: "2026-12-26"
  timezone: "America/New_York"
  action: Deny
```

## Actions

| Action | When Active | When Inactive |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| `Allow` | Deployments proceed | Deployments blocked |
| `Deny` | Deployments blocked | Deployments proceed |

## Annotations

| Annotation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `gate.kuberik.com/pretty-name` | Display name shown in dashboard |
| `gate.kuberik.com/description` | Description shown in dashboard |

## Rule Options

Each rule can combine:
- `timeRange` - Start/end in HH:MM format (24-hour), supports cross-midnight
- `daysOfWeek` - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
- `dateRange` - Start/end in YYYY-MM-DD format

Rules are OR'd: the schedule is active if *any* rule matches.

## Examples

### Block Peak Hours

```yaml {filename="peak-hours.yaml"}
apiVersion: kuberik.com/v1alpha1
kind: RolloutSchedule
metadata:
  name: peak-hours-deny
spec:
  rolloutSelector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  rules:
    - name: "peak-traffic"
      timeRange:
        start: "11:00"
        end: "14:00"
      daysOfWeek: [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday]
  action: Deny
```

### Weekend Only

```yaml {filename="weekend-only.yaml"}
apiVersion: kuberik.com/v1alpha1
kind: RolloutSchedule
metadata:
  name: weekend-only
spec:
  rolloutSelector:
    matchLabels:
      schedule: weekend
  rules:
    - name: "weekend"
      daysOfWeek: [Saturday, Sunday]
  action: Allow
```

### Night Deployments

```yaml {filename="night.yaml"}
apiVersion: kuberik.com/v1alpha1
kind: RolloutSchedule
metadata:
  name: night-deployment
spec:
  rolloutSelector:
    matchLabels:
      schedule: night
  rules:
    - name: "overnight"
      timeRange:
        start: "22:00"
        end: "06:00"
  action: Allow
```

### Multiple Windows

Rules are OR'd together—deployments proceed if *any* rule matches.

```yaml {filename="flexible.yaml"}
apiVersion: kuberik.com/v1alpha1
kind: RolloutSchedule
metadata:
  name: flexible-windows
spec:
  rolloutSelector:
    matchLabels:
      schedule: flexible
  rules:
    - name: "morning"
      timeRange: {start: "06:00", end: "09:00"}
      daysOfWeek: [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday]
    - name: "evening"
      timeRange: {start: "18:00", end: "22:00"}
      daysOfWeek: [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday]
    - name: "weekend"
      daysOfWeek: [Saturday, Sunday]
  action: Allow
```
