Chain environments together so production deploys only after staging succeeds. Requires the [GitHub Integration](/docs/integrations/github/).

## Define Environments

Both environments must use the same backend project so they can coordinate via shared deployment status.

Create the upstream environment (staging):

```yaml {filename="staging.yaml"}
apiVersion: environments.kuberik.com/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: my-app-staging
spec:
  rolloutRef:
    name: my-app
  name: staging
  backend:
    type: github
    project: org/repo
    secret: github-credentials
```

Create the downstream environment (production) with a relationship:

```yaml {filename="production.yaml"}
apiVersion: environments.kuberik.com/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: my-app-production
spec:
  rolloutRef:
    name: my-app
  name: production
  backend:
    type: github
    project: org/repo
    secret: github-credentials
  relationship:
    environment: staging
    type: After
```

{{< callout >}}
The controller automatically creates RolloutGate resources based on relationships. With `type: After`, only versions successfully baked in staging become available for production.
{{< /callout >}}

## Relationship Types

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `After` | Deploy only after the related environment succeeds |
| `Parallel` | Deploy in parallel with the related environment |

## Recommended: Add a Schedule

Combine with a [Deployment Schedule](/docs/guides/schedules/) to prevent automatic promotions when your team isn't around.
