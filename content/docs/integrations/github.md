The Kuberik [Environment API](/docs/concepts/environments/) uses the GitHub [Environments](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/environments) and [Deployments](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/deployments) APIs as a coordination layer for multi-cluster promotions.



## Setup

### Create GitHub Token

- Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Click **Generate new token (classic)**
- Select scopes:
   - `repo:deployment` (Read and write access to deployments)
- Copy the generated token

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Store this token securely. It provides write access to your repository.
{{< /callout >}}

### Create Kubernetes Secret

```bash
kubectl create secret generic github-credentials \
  --from-literal=token=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  -n default
```

Verify:
```bash
kubectl get secret github-credentials
```

### Configure Environment Backend

Reference the secret in your Environment:

```yaml
apiVersion: environments.kuberik.com/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: production
spec:
  rolloutRef:
    name: my-app
  name: "production"
  backend:
    type: github
    project: "my-org/my-repo"    # owner/repo format
    secret: "github-credentials"  # Secret name
```

## Dashboard: Commit Changelists

The Rollout Dashboard can show what a deploy changes — the commits and diffstat between the running build and the one you are about to ship — in the Change Version dialog, on rollout detail and in Activity. It does this by signing each user in to GitHub through a **GitHub App**, so everyone sees only the repositories they can already read.

This is independent of the token above: the Environment backend uses a PAT per namespace; the dashboard uses app credentials, hub cluster only.

{{% steps %}}

### Create a GitHub App

**Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**, on the org that owns your source repositories.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Callback URL | `https://<dashboard-host>/api/auth/github/callback` |
| Expire user authorization tokens | **unchecked** |
| Webhook → Active | **unchecked** |
| Repository permissions | **Contents: Read-only** (Metadata: Read-only is added for you) |

`<dashboard-host>` is the host users open the dashboard on. With multiple clusters that is the hub; spokes redirect to it and need nothing.

### Install it

**Install App** on the org or user, for the repositories your rollouts are built from.

### Copy the credentials

On the app's **General** page note the **Client ID** and **Generate a new client secret**. The app's private key is not used.

### Create the Secret

```bash
kubectl -n kuberik-system create secret generic github-app-credentials \
  --from-literal=clientId='<client id>' \
  --from-literal=clientSecret='<client secret>'
kubectl -n kuberik-system rollout restart deploy/rollout-dashboard
```

The dashboard reads it as `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`. The Secret is optional — without it the dashboard runs and its navbar reads **Not configured**.

### Verify

```bash
curl -s https://<dashboard-host>/api/auth/github/status
# {"configured":true,"connected":false}
```

The navbar now offers **Connect GitHub**. Sign in once; commit lists fill from the next Change Version on.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
`redirect_uri is not associated with this application` from GitHub means the Callback URL on the app does not match `https://<dashboard-host>/api/auth/github/callback` exactly — scheme and host included.
